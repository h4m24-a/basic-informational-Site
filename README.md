Basic Website practicing Node.js & Express.js:
- HTML 
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features

- Utilized Node.js built-in modules (http, fs/promises, path) to create a simple HTTP server.
- Configured the server to route requests to specific HTML files based on the URL
- Implemented a 404 error page (404.html) to be displayed when a user tries to access a page that is not listed above.
- Tested the server locally by accessing various URLs (localhost:8080, localhost:8080/about, localhost:8080/contact-me, and others) to ensure proper routing functionality.
- Implemented error handling to catch and handle server errors, providing appropriate responses to clients.
- Used express.static to serve static files.
